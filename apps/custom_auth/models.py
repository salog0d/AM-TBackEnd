    CustomUser Model
    This model extends Django's built-in AbstractUser to provide additional fields and functionality
    specific to the application's requirements. It introduces roles, disciplines, and other custom
    attributes for user management.
    Attributes:
        ROLE_CHOICES (tuple): Defines the possible roles a user can have:
            - 'athlete': Represents an athlete.
            - 'coach': Represents a coach.
            - 'admin': Represents an administrator.
        DISCIPLINE_CHOICES (tuple): Defines the possible disciplines a user can be associated with,
        such as 'Athletics', 'Soccer', 'Basketball', etc.
        profile_picture (ImageField): Optional field to store the user's profile picture.
        role (CharField): Specifies the user's role, with a default value of 'athlete'.
        name (CharField): Optional field to store the user's full name.
        discipline (CharField): Specifies the user's discipline, chosen from DISCIPLINE_CHOICES.
        date_of_birth (DateField): Optional field to store the user's date of birth.
        phone_number (CharField): Optional field to store the user's phone number.
        email (EmailField): Stores the user's email address, which must be unique.
        coach (ForeignKey): A self-referential field to assign a coach to an athlete. Only users with
            the role 'coach' can be assigned as a coach. This field is optional and only applicable
            for users with the role 'athlete'.
    Methods:
        clean(): Validates the model's data before saving. Ensures:
            - Athletes must have a coach assigned.
            - The assigned coach must have the role of 'coach'.
            - Only athletes can have a coach assigned.
        save(*args, **kwargs): Overrides the default save method to call the clean method before saving.
        is_athlete(): Returns True if the user's role is 'athlete'.
        is_coach(): Returns True if the user's role is 'coach'.
        is_admin(): Returns True if the user's role is 'admin'.
        __str__(): Returns the user's name as the string representation of the object.
    Usage:
        This model is designed to handle user roles and relationships in a sports tracking
        and monitoring application. It enforces role-based constraints and provides utility
        methods for role identification.
